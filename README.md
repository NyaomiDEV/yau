# YAU - "Yet Another Updater" (previously known as `pinkpill`)

Utility to periodically check for updates via your preferred AUR helper.

## Premise

**This updater was made in Node + TypeScript as a meme.**

If you can run it, it will work fine.
However, do not expect it to be light in resource usage, given that it runs on Node.

If optimizations can be done I will be glad to make them, so that this package is viable to more and more people.

I do plan to port this to another programming language that is compiled and better at handling CPU and memory than Node is; however, for that to happen, I need to learn it first. I am trying.

Lastly DO NOT COMPLAIN about me using Node to write desktop daemons.
It is not my fault if the standard library is mature enough to make them.

Then again, I am doing this as a deliberate meme (and for personal usage, but again, it is viable for me to use Node for this kind of stuff as the impact on my PC is not there, really. If you are tight on RAM or processing power then look elsewhere for update checkers.)

## How it works

It's a simple daemon. It runs silently and it notifies you whenever updates are available.

Clicking the update button in the notification will spawn your terminal and from there you can update your system.

## Installation

You'll need `nodejs`, `yarn`, `fakeroot`, `pacman` (ofc), an AUR helper to get updates from (default is `yay`), a terminal emulator which accepts commands via the `-e` argument (default is `xterm`)

```
yarn && yarn yau
```

If someone wants to make a PKGBUILD out of this, you're welcome to do so. PR it then.

## Usage

Run `yau --extract-config` to make the utility place its configuration file.

Go edit the configuration file before running `yau`!

If you're all set, just add `yau` to your autostart list.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `$HOME/.config/yau/config.json`.

Configuration values are self explanatory.

```js
{
	"warmupSeconds": 30,                   /* How many seconds to wait before checking for updates the first time */
	"checkIntervalSeconds": 3600,          /* Interval between checks (in seconds) */
	"notificationDurationSeconds": 10,     /* Interval for which the notification is visible (in seconds) */
	"aurHelperBinary": "/usr/bin/yay",     /* Full path to the AUR helper binary */
	"terminalBinary": "/usr/bin/xterm",    /* Full path to the terminal emulator binary */
	"Syy": false                           /* Should the utility use -Syy when updating the database and updating the system? */
};
```

## To do

- Test all common AUR helpers with this. Currently tested are `yay` and `paru`.
